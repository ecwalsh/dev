# Sliding Window

## About
- A pattern which seeks to reduce the use of one or more nested loops and replace them with a single iteration
- Avoids duplicated work of brute force approach
- Can be viewed as a subset of the `two pointers` method 
- Moves through possible subsets and compare desired outcomes

---

## When to Use
- Everything is grouped in a sequence
- There is some sequential criteria (min/max sum, longest/shortest substring or subsequence, contains, etc.)

---

## Complexity
- Most sliding window problems can be solved in `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity

---

## Variants
- Fixed Window
- Dynamic Window
- Dyanimc Window with Auxillary Data Structure
